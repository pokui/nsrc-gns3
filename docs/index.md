This guide describes how to build and use NSRC's GNS3-based virtual training platform.

# Overview

TODO

# Dependencies

We recommend that the lab has an external Internet connection, as this will
allow students to access the Internet when connected to the class network.

However, the platform is designed so that if the external Internet connection
is lost, the labs can continue unaffected.  The platform provides local DNS
and routing.

# Licensing

All parts of the training platform are free and open source, with the
exception of the Cisco IOSv and IOSvL2 images.

You can obtain these by purchasing a licence for
[VIRL](http://virl.cisco.com/), which at the time of writing costs $199 per
year.  After purchase, login with your Cisco account and download the images.
