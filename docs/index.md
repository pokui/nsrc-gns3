This guide describes how to build and use NSRC's GNS3-based virtual training platform.

# Overview

TODO

# Licensing

All parts of the training platform are free and open source, with the
exception of the Cisco IOSv and IOSvL2 images.

You can obtain these by purchasing a licence for
[VIRL](http://virl.cisco.com/), which at the time of writing costs $199 per
year.  After purchase, login with your Cisco account and download the images.
